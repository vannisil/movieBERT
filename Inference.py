As the ship collides with an iceberg and tragedy strikes, Jack and Rose must navigate the chaos and danger to survive.", "\"Rocky\" is a 1976 American sports drama film written and starring Sylvester Stallone. The film follows the story of Rocky Balboa, a small-time boxer from Philadelphia, who gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship. Despite being an underdog, Rocky seizes the opportunity to train rigorously and face the reigning champion, Apollo Creed, in a match that becomes a symbol of determination and the human spirit.", "\"Airplane!\" (1980), directed by Jim Abrahams and the Zucker brothers. The movie is a spoof of disaster films and follows the story of Ted Striker, a former fighter pilot, who must overcome his fear of flying to save a flight full of passengers when the crew falls ill due to food poisoning. Packed with absurd and slapstick humor, \"Airplane!\" is known for its rapid-fire jokes, visual gags, and memorable one-liners, making it a classic in the genre of parody comedy."]
